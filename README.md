**Python Chatbot Project ü§ñ**

##üöÄ Project Description  
Welcome to the **Python Chatbot Project**! This repository provides a framework for creating an intelligent chatbot in Python that leverages machine learning (ML) to provide automated, context-aware responses. The chatbot learns from user interactions, improving over time and delivering more accurate results.

### Key Features:
- **Machine Learning Powered**: Uses advanced ML algorithms to generate relevant, human-like responses.
- **Language Independence**: Train the chatbot in multiple programming languages.
- **Self-improvement**: The more the bot interacts, the better it gets at providing accurate responses.
- **Simple & Scalable**: Easily extendable for different use cases, including customer support, entertainment, and education.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **ChatterBot** - A simple library for creating chatbots using machine learning.
- **TensorFlow** - For training the model using deep learning.
- **NLTK** - Natural Language Toolkit for tokenizing and preprocessing data.
- **Pandas** - For dataset manipulation and preprocessing.
- **scikit-learn** - For machine learning utilities, such as data preprocessing.
- **Git** - For version control and collaboration.

## üîß Installation Instructions  

Follow the steps below to install the chatbot and run it locally.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuvavinith/AI_ChatBot.git
cd AI_ChatBot
````

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. It‚Äôs recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install chatterbot
pip install chatterbot_corpus
pip install tensorflow pandas scikit-learn
```

For the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot.git@master
```

## üí¨ Usage Example

Here‚Äôs how you can interact with the chatbot:

### 1. **Train the chatbot**:

```python
from chatterbot import ChatBot
from chatterbot.trainers import ListTrainer

chatbot = ChatBot('PythonBot')
trainer = ListTrainer(chatbot)

# Training the chatbot with sample data
trainer.train([
    "Hi",
    "Hello, how can I assist you?",
    "Bye",
    "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
])
```

### 2. **Chat with the chatbot**:

```python
response = chatbot.get_response("Hi")
print(response)
```

## üß† Development Process

### 1. **Problem Definition**

The goal of this chatbot is to respond to user queries automatically using ML techniques. It improves over time as it learns from user interactions. The chatbot is designed to handle multiple languages and can be easily trained to handle diverse use cases.

### 2. **Design Thinking**

We followed a step-by-step approach:

* **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenizing, lemmatizing, and cleaning the input text.
* **Training**: Using ML models to create the responses.
* **Testing**: Using datasets and manual input to evaluate the bot's accuracy and response quality.

### 3. **Data Collection**

The dataset for training the chatbot comes from real-world conversations, including:

* Frequently asked questions
* Simple dialogues suitable for chatbot interaction

The dataset is available for download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grafstor/simple-dialogs-for-chatbot).

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate the chatbot‚Äôs performance using common metrics:

* **BLEU Score**: Measures the similarity between generated responses and expected answers.
* **F1 Score**: Measures the precision and recall for response classification.
* **Human Testing**: We conduct regular user testing to assess the conversational quality of the bot.

---

## üå± Future Work

The project is in continuous improvement, and we plan to enhance it by:

* **Adding more training datasets** to improve response quality.
* **Integrating advanced NLP techniques** such as BERT or GPT to generate more human-like conversations.
* **Deployment**: Planning to deploy the chatbot on platforms like Slack, Facebook Messenger, or integrate it with websites.
